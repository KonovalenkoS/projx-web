        Below are the conditions for ProjX funding for summer 2016. Email questions to <a href="mailto:projx@mit.edu">projx@mit.edu</a>.

        <br>

        <h2>requirements</h2>
        By applying to ProjX, you agree to meet the following requirements:
        <ul>
          <li>Attend an in-person check-in before the end of the semester.</li>
          <li>Schedule two virtual or in-person check-ins over the summer.</li>
          <li>Display your project at a ProjX showcase in September. (If you can't make the date, you can make this up by demoing at either xFair or ProjX Demo Day in February 2017.)</li>
          <li>Allow TechX to use imagery and descriptions of your project and to make them public to the MIT community.</li>
          <li>Maintain communication with ProjX throughout the semester, including alerting ProjX if unexpected delays or problems arise that may prevent you from displaying your project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>selection criteria</h2>

        The goal of ProjX is to enable students to engage in impactful and educational projects, and we will fund projects that we believe achieve this goal.

        <br>

        <h2>reimbursement guidelines</h2>

        Funding will be provided as staged reimbursements. Up to $150 will be provided after check-in two and the remaining balance for a total of up to $250 after the showcase in September.

        <br><br>

        Only purchases of parts or materials directly benefiting the project are eligible for reimbursement. Note that software projects are eligible for funding. Examples of purchases not eligible for reimbursement include, but are not limited to, food, marketing, advertisements, location rental costs, and machine shop membership fees. Take this into account when formulating your budget.

        <br><br>

        Reimbursements will be processed through MIT's RFP system. Tax will not be reimbursed (you may use MIT's tax exemption forms). Proof of purchase and payment must be presented for reimbursement.
