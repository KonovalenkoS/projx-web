        Below are the conditions for ProjX funding for summer 2016. Email any questions to <a href="mailto:projx@mit.edu">projx@mit.edu</a>.

        <br>

        <h2>requirements</h2>
        By applying to ProjX, you agree to meet the following requirements:

          <li>Attend an in-person check-in before the end of the semester.</li>
          <li>Schedule two virtual or in-person check-ins over the summer.</li>
          <li>Display your project at a ProjX showcase in September. (If you can't make the date, you can make this up by demoing at either xFair or ProjX Demo Day in February 2017.)</li>
          <li>Allow TechX to use imagery and descriptions of your project and to make them public to the MIT community.</li>
          <li>Maintain communication with ProjX throughout the funding period, including alerting ProjX if unexpected delays or problems arise that may prevent you from displaying your project.</li>
        </ul>
        You retain the rights and owernship over everything you create.

        <h2>selection criteria</h2>

        The goal of ProjX is to enable students to engage in impactful and educational projects, and we will fund projects that we believe achieve this goal. Some more specific factors include:
        <ul>
          <li>Novelty and creativity</li>
          <li>Educational value</li>
          <li>How enabling ProjX support would be</li>
          <li>Expectation of successful completion</li>
          <li>Overall cost</li>
        </ul>
        Note that this year we are expanding to consider software projects.

        <h2>reimbursement guidelines</h2>

        Expenses that directly add value to the output of the project are eligible for reimbursement. Examples of eligible costs are electronic sensors and raw materials. Examples of ineligible costs are marketing, food, renting lab space, or costs associated with user testing. Running costs (like server, maintenance, etc.) must include a proposed time frame and have clear positive impact. Please take this into account when formulating your budget.

        <br><br>

        Funding will be provided as staged reimbursements. For the summer round, up to $150 will be provided after check-in two and the remaining balance for a total of up to $250 after the showcase in September.

        <br><br>

        Reimbursements will be processed through MIT's RFP system. Tax will not be reimbursed (and you may use MIT's tax exemption forms). Physical proof of purchase and payment must be presented for reimbursement. We reserve the right to deny reimbursement if the requirements are not fully met.
